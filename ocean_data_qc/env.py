from bokeh.util.logconfig import bokeh_logger as lg


class Environment(object):
    ''' This class is used to shared all the vbles across the application.
        This are visible on the python classes of the folders.
            * bokeh_models through the class Environment
            * data_models through the class SharedCruiseData

        This class is created to avoid sending shared variables to
        the other classes constructors. Like this the variables are
        always updated. This should be done in the rest of classes:

            from ocean_data_qc.env import Environment

            [...]

                self.env = Environment

        NOTE: Here I cannot instantiate the other objects as children >> recursive inheritance
